# IN2009 Coursework

This coursework is for the IN2009 module: Language processors. 

## Configuration
Before starting we need to configure the `SSM.jar` and `SBNF.jar` libraries for this project. These should be added as classpaths.
We are mapping the corresponding class files to the class names. 
These are needed for language information

## What are we doing
In the root directory of the project you can find a file called `The_Semantics_of_LPL` this explains in detail all the information about the language
we will be implementing.

It tells how LPL programs are supposed to behave when you run them. The LPL language is basically a smaller version of Java but also contains 
some differences

Implement the `AST` classes
complete the implementation of the parser
